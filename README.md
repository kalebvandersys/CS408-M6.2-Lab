# 6.2 Letterheaded Paper

This project is creating a nicely formatted letter with css and html. It also has 
a little javascript.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project locally. 
There is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally, you
do not need to setup a local server to run the project. Please run the live preview, then
copy the link and put it in your browser. (After installing the extension, click the name 
of the project at the top of VSCode, click show and run commands, then type and select 
"Live Preview:Start Server".) For this project, shrink your webpage to about half width to
match assignment requirements
